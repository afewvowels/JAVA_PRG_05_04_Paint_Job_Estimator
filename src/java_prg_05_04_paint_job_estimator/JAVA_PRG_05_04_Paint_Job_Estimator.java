 * A painting company has determined that for every 115 square feet of wall
 * space, one gallon of paint land eight hours of labor will be required. The
 * company charges $18.00 per hour for labor. Write a program that allows the
 * user to enter the number of rooms to be painted and the price of the paint
 * per gallon. It should also ask for the square feet of wall space in each
 * room. The program should have methods that return the following data:
 * 
 *      * The number of gallons of paint required
 *      * The hours of labor required
 *      * The cost of the paint
 *      * The labor charges
 *      * The total cost of the paint job
 * 
 * Then it should display the data on the screen.
